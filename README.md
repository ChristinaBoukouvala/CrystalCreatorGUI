# CrystalCreatorGUI

Hi, 

Thanks for visiting the Crystal Creator GUI github directory. Crystal Creator has been co-developed by Christina Boukouvala, Elizabeth R. Hopper, Dawn Kelly, Pip Knight  and Emilie Ringe.

Please note the details below regarding the available Crystal Creator versions:

1. Crystal Creator MAC version currenty supports ONLY FCC and HCP modelling.
2. Crystal Ctreator Windows version currently supports FCC, BCC, BCT and HCP modelling.

For user guuidance, updates and limitations on the use of the code, please see the help file.
